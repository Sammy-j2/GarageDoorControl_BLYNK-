# GarageDoorControl_BLYNK-
Code to control garage door with Blynk

I was tired of having to have a remote to open the garage for each vehicle/motorcycle. So, I made this code to use with the BLYNK app.

I wired a relay to the button on the inside of the garadge and this simple script triggers the circut to close the circut.

The app lets me know if the door is open or closed and lets me close is as long as I have internet access on the device I am using to interface with Blynk
